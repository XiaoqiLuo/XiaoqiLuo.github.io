# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a research assistant in Guangzhou lab, mainly responsible for genome and transcriptome process building, algorithm comparison and optimization. Prior to that, I finished my master program at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked on Predicting gene-regulatory motifs from large-scale transcriptome resources under the supervision of Dr Cei Abreu-Goodger, and have ongoing collaborations with their group. and have ongoing collaboration with their group. My research interests focus on the use and optimization of bioinformatics tools to analyze and integrate multi-omics NGS (genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic) data to extract transcriptional regulatory and motif information.I am also interested in molecular typing of cancer, immune microenvironment and integrated multi-omics analysis, which was my research topic during my undergraduate studies.
